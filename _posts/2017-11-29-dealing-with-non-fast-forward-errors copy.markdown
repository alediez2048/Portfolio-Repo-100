**1) Bad SEO**

One of the worst parts about using a website builder to create a business website is that the builder spits out a jumble of code that is not structured well. It doesn’t contain the necessary elements to help websites rank better in Google.

SEO Stands for search engine optimization and its the methodology of making your website show up higher in Google and other search engines. There are many pieces to SEO but one of the most important parts is on-page SEO. This is the code and structure of the site and they have a large impact on the SEO-friendliness of the website.

When you build your site with these website builders you do not have control of the code…just the design. You can’t use [structured data to increase your local SEO](https://www.tytonmedia.com/blog/structured-data-seo-schema-markup/) or even add content. Growing your online presence is a huge part of getting more online visitors and customers. These website builders don’t allow you to create new content so you will rarely rank in Google.

**2) Flash Based**

Another reason websites builders are bad for SEO is that they are flash based. Google and other search engines can’t read flash so they have no idea what the website is about. Not to mentioned that flash is very slow and kind of old school.

Flash is also [very insecure](http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-secure-is-flash-heres-what-adobe-wont-tell-you/), can’t be searched, doesn’t have text content and is a nightmare for search bots. I highly suggest staying away from website builders that use flash.

**3) No Structure**

The other issue with only have 1 page is that you do not have a website structure which is essential to SEO. When a website is organized nicely and according to a site hierarchy, you make search engines very happy and they are often going to rank that website higher.

A URL strucure should be organized to match the hierarchy:

[www.tytonmedia.com/services/business-website/](http://www.tytonmedia.com/services/business-website/)

As you can see, our structure matches the hierarchy of each level with good keywords that explain the page and content. When you create a website with companies like Wix, Weebly or Squarespace, you aren’t going to get a good hierarchy or structure…

**6) No Competitor Diversification**

Many website builder companies like to say that you can create a _stunning website_ with their software. The problem is that ‘stunning’ has a context. If the last time your website was redesigned was 10 years ago, then a 1 page Wix website may seem stunning to you. But technology is growing very fast and the web design market has grown with it.

Stunning websites these days are much more than just a single page that a lawyer, doctor or chiropractor throws together in 30 minutes. When we build a website we create a experience for the user that engages them and builds trust. A stunning website is a website that brings in traffic and converts that traffic to paying customers and most website builder sites **don’t do that**.

**6) No Competitor Diversification**

Let’s do some math… Wix.com currently has over 90 million users. On their website, they mention that they have about 500 customizable templates. If we do some simple math… 90,000,000 users / 500 templates = 180,000. That means that if you use Wix, you are probably using the same template as 180,000 other people.

This really diminishes your brand in so many ways. Not only do 180,000 other peoples website resemble yours, customers know you are using a cheap website builder to create a website and brand.

48% of people cited a website’s design as the number one factor in deciding the credibility of a business (source: [IronPaper](http://www.ironpaper.com/webintel/articles/10-web-design-statistics/))

Customers want to know you are a legitimate business that spends more than $30 on their online brand. This builds trust and brand awareness. When you go the cheap route with your business website, you are going to get cheap results.

**7) No Support**

In order for a website to grow, you have to water it. When you create a website with Weebly, Wix or Sqaurespace you don’t get the support you need or deserve. Is should not be your job to keep your website running and up-to-date!

What if your website goes down or something stops working on it? Do you have the skills it takes to fix it before your customers notice? A lot of the time, certain pieces of a website can stop working and you may not even know it. Customers may be trying to contact you, but you’re not a webmaster, how would you know?

Having a dedicated support team is essential and necessary to having an online website. They can make sure your website is up, running and functional so that your customers can find you 24/7, 365.

**8) Not CMS (content management system) Based**

CMS systems are a powerful tool to help manage websites and their content. Content management systems like WordPress facilitate writing, editing, organizing and publishing content online.

You can have full control over files, design, documents and how you display your content.

When you use a website builder you are creating static HTML web pages that are no match for content management systems.

**9) Slow Website Speed**

Having a slow website is bad for visitors, sales and even search engine rankings. Google knows everything about your website including how long it takes to load it. If it takes a long time to load, you will get dinged in the search engines and probably by your visitors as well.

The change in a website bounce rate spikes to 100% when a page takes 4 seconds or more to load. It jumps to 150% if a page takes 8 seconds or more to load. (Source:[Hubspot](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/compelling-stats-website-design-optimization-list))

With companies like Wix and Squarespace, you are on a server with a ton of other people. This creates less resources and slower websites which is bad for everyone.

Websites should be hosted on a fast server that don’t have a large amount of other websites hosted on it.

**10) You Don’t Own the Website**

Like I mentioned before, you aren’t able to migrate a site created with a website builder. Which also means that you don’t even own the website. If you wanted to move it, you couldn’t… which means the company you built it with, owns it.

**11) Not an Actual Domain Name**

With some website builder sites you don’t even get your own domain name. They will give you a URL like mycompany.wix.com or goodbusiness.weebly.com which is pretty much worthless. This diminishes brand value, trust and the likelihood that anyone is going to contact you to do business from your website.

Having your own domain name is what sets you apart on the web. It allows you to build backlinks to your domain increasing the traffic and customers.

**12) Wrapping Up**

In conclusion, its a very bad idea to create your business website using a cheap website builder like Wix, Weebly or Sqaurespace. Many customers shy away from businesses that use these type of services to create their website.

Instead, enlist the help of a professional [website design company](https://www.tytonmedia.com/services/business-website/) that can create a responsive website for an affordable price. Stop trying to do it yourself and redesign your website to adhere to the latest standards and SEO practices so that you can grow your online presence resulting in more traffic, leads and customers.
