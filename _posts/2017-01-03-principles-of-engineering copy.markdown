A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.

I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a

Whether you believe that or not, the long nights, cold weather and trying to keep to new year resolutions are all probably getting to you a little by now. To make matters worse many will still be recovering from their Christmas spending

So how can you make today – and the rest of January – a little better for you and your wallet? Well, if times are tight, a little extra in your pocket should make the month more bearable. Here are four easy ways to do just that.

The average smoker lights up 12 cigarettes a day, adding up to nearly £150 in January. Having five less pints of beer or glasses of wine each week could easily save you £100 this month.

The sales are still on, and with the temperatures dropping there’s probably the temptation to kit yourself out in a new jumper or winter coat. Well if you’ve got some old woollies down the back of the wardrobe, there’s a good chance your friends do too. Getting a group of you together to swap clothes means you’re getting a new look for free, adding some extra pounds to your purse to save or spend elsewhere.
